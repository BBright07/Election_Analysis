# Election_Analysis
##Project Overview
This project is aimed at supporting a Colorado Board of Elections employee with the election audit of a recent congressional district election. The total number of votes was calculated along with percentages of subtotals for each candidate and county. Voter participation and candidate votes were verified to ensure the validity of the results and confirmation of the winner.

##Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code. 1.38.1

##Summary
Three candidates ran for the election: Charles C. Stockham, Diana Degette, and Raymon A. Doane. Three counties were at stake for the congressional election: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties. The total votes were 369,711. The election vote count per candidate throughout the counties is as follows:
-Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
-Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
-Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The results show a striking victory for Diana Degette. 
Further insights on voting patterns demonstrate that the county of Denver had the largest voter turnout with 82.8% of the votes.

##Challenge Overview
Overall, this challenge helped integrate decision statements, for loops, and calculations to ease the process of vote counting in terms of both count accuracy and speed. Python played a key role in creating summaries of important voting patterns across counties, and analyses that are helpful to produce official election results.

##Challenge Summary
This challenge was helpful to adavance democratic efforts and also hone skills in python while learning about dependencies, modules and packages that offer a myriad of toolkits to perform many other challenges. In the case of this challenge, python was crucial in providing accurate and reliable election audits that can in turn be utilized across the state of Colorado.
